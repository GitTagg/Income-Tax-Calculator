        <h3> What is Income Tax?</h3>

        <p>Income Tax is a tax you pay on your total gross income. This Tax Calculator is for the tax year 2022/23, starting from 6th April 2022 until 5th April 2023.</p>
        
        <h3>How is it calculated?</h3>

        <p>Everyone has a 'personal allowance'. This is the amount we can earn without paying any income tax. If you earn more than your personal allowance, you pay tax at the applicable income tax rate on all earnings above the personal allowance, but the allowance itself remains untaxed. The basic personal allowance is £12,570 for 2022/23.</p>
          <p>Once you know your personal allowance, anything extra earned above that will be subject to income tax. For the 2022/23 tax year, if you live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, there are three marginal income tax bands – the 20% basic rate, the 40% higher rate and the 45% additional rate (also remember your personal allowance starts to shrink once earnings hit £100,000). Marginal bands mean you only pay the specified tax rate on that portion of salary. For example, if your salary puts you in the 40% tax bracket, then you only pay 40% tax on the segment of earnings in that income tax band. For the lower part of your earnings, you'll still pay the appropriate 20% or 0%.</p>
